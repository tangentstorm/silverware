* about

This repository contains turbo pascal code written from 1992 to 1996 by michal j wallace.

It primarily consists of text-mode MS-DOS programs, including a user interface widget library, many string routines, etc.

I am currently in the process of reviewing and reviving this code with the help of the [[http://freepascal.org/][free pascal compiler]].
